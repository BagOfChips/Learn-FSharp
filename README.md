<h1>Learn F#</h1>

### Comp 302 - Programming Languages and Paradigms - Winter 2017

Learing F# for functional programming as part of my course.

May choose to continue posting notes, maybe assignments as well.

Code is heavily commented, may choose to turn into a website depending on how much I like the language.
